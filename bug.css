The CSS rule `:nth-child(n)` selector can be tricky to use correctly, especially when dealing with complex nesting or dynamic content. A common mistake is misunderstanding how the `n` variable works and its starting point (1), which can lead to unexpected styling results. Another issue arises when combining `:nth-child` with other selectors, causing specificity conflicts that may override your intended styles.
