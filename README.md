# Unexpected Styling with :nth-child() Selector in CSS
This repository demonstrates a common issue encountered when using the `:nth-child()` selector in CSS. The problem involves unexpected styling behavior caused by misinterpreting the selector's logic and specificity conflicts with other selectors. 

## Bug Description
The primary issue is unexpected styling results when using `:nth-child(n)` to target specific elements within a nested structure or dynamic content. Misunderstanding how the `n` variable works and its starting index (1) often leads to incorrect styling. Another issue is specificity conflicts. When combining `:nth-child` with other selectors, specificity rules may override the intended styles of `:nth-child`, resulting in unexpected behavior. 

## Bug Solution
The solution includes correcting the `:nth-child` selector logic, ensuring it accurately targets the desired elements.  Adjustments in the CSS structure and possibly the addition of more specific selectors or using the `:nth-of-type` selector might resolve specificity conflicts and produce the expected styling outcome. The solution also addresses the problem by carefully examining the selector's logic, starting point, and the document's structure to ensure accurate targeting. It explores alternatives, such as using a different CSS selector to avoid specificity conflicts.
